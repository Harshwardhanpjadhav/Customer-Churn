# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
![alt text](https://www.cleartouch.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Customer-Churn.png)

This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning techniques. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers cease doing business with a company. Predicting churn is crucial for businesses as it allows them to take proactive steps to retain customers.

## Overview

In this project, we utilize machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for customer churn. The model is trained on historical data that includes information about telecom customers and whether they churned or not.

## Project Overview
- **Problem Statement:** Predict telecom customer churn using machine learning.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, Flask (for deployment).
- **Model:** We trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost) and selected the best-performing one.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** We used accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.

## Dataset
- We used the [Telecom Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/telecom-customer-churn-by-maven-analytics?select=telecom_customer_churn.csv) for this project. This dataset contains information about customer demographics, usage patterns, and whether they churned or not.
