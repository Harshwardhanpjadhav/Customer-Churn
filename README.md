# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning techniques. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers cease doing business with a company. Predicting churn is crucial for businesses as it allows them to take proactive steps to retain customers.

## Overview

In this project, we utilize machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for customer churn. The model is trained on historical data that includes information about telecom customers and whether they churned or not.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found in the `data` directory. It contains the following files:

- `telecom_data.csv`: This CSV file contains the customer data, including features and the churn label.

## Features

The dataset includes the following features:

- `Feature 1`: Description of feature 1.
- `Feature 2`: Description of feature 2.
- ...
- `Feature n`: Description of feature n.
